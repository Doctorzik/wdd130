        <h2>Resources that can help everyone become a sofware developer</h2>
      <p>If becoming a full stack developer is your goal, then this page is for you. This
        page will guide you through some resources that can enhance your dreams of becoming a full
          stack developer. Like Zik, you  might also be wondering how you can figure out what resources
          you need and where to locate them.
      </p>
      <p>These resources are not concise, but you are encourage to take in-depth look at the resources and following through 
        to be able to get comfortable with them. You are also encourage to seek help from the resource owners
        and take advantage of the different channels made available by the sites to quicken your understanding.

      <p>Everyone can be motivated but not everyonehas the grit to continue</p>
